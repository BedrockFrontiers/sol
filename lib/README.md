### Libraries Directory

The `lib/` directory contains native libraries and modules for the Sol language. These libraries provide additional functionality and capabilities beyond what is available in the standard library, allowing developers to extend the language with custom features and utilities.

#### Directory Structure

- `network/`: Library for network-related functionality, such as HTTP requests, TCP/IP communication, and socket programming.
- `filesystem/`: Library for interacting with the filesystem, including file I/O operations, directory manipulation, and file metadata retrieval.
- `crypto/`: Library for cryptographic operations, including hashing algorithms, encryption, and digital signatures.
- `data/`: Library for data processing and manipulation, including data structures, algorithms, and serialization/deserialization utilities.
- etc.

#### Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the development of native libraries for the Sol language, you can help by creating new libraries, improving existing ones, and adding new features and functionalities. Contributions can include bug fixes, performance optimizations, documentation improvements, and more.
