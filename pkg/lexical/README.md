This project houses the lexical analyzer (lexer) for the Sol language.

#### Lexical Analyzer (Lexer)

The lexer is a crucial component of the Sol programming language. It's responsible for breaking down the source code into meaningful tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

##### Features

- Tokenizes source code into a stream of tokens.
- Identifies keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
- Handles whitespace and comments appropriately.
- Provides basic error handling for invalid input.

#### Usage

To utilize the lexer, include the `lexical.h` header file in your C/C++ project and call the necessary functions to tokenize the input source code.

#### Contribution:

Contributors are encouraged to expand the test suite by adding new test cases to cover additional language features, edge cases, and error scenarios. Consistent and comprehensive testing helps maintain the quality and stability of the Sol language implementation. But first, read the [Contributing Guide](../../docs/contributing.md)
